# Potabi PKG files
Please ONLY EVER use software made in our [ports](https://github.com/potabi/ports). Not FreeBSD's ports.

Some software may have conflicting names, such as packages that were not named properly. They are to not be renamed until someone makes a whole new package - we do not want to risk breaking anything and it's easiest not to do that when you don't touch it.
